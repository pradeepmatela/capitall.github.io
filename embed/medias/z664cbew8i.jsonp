And I'm\n\ngoing to talk today about how we can skip endless dashboards\n\nand get straight to the why. So there's three questions that\n\nyou're asked constantly about what's going on in the\n\nbusiness. The first is exactly that. What is happening? For\n\nthe key metrics that we care about what is happening to\n\nthose numbers? But the minute that we answer that question,\n\nand tell people what's happening, the next question is why?\n\nWhy are the numbers doing that? And once we know the whys,\n\nit's how do we change this? What are the actions we can take\n\nto improve the metrics were focused on. And so that's a\n\ncycle, each one informs the next. And today, the main\n\ntechnology that we have on our hands is dashboards. If we\n\nwant to be able to tell the business or know what's\n\nhappening with one of our metrics, we create a dashboard for\n\nit. The problem is dashboards don't tell us why. Why are the\n\nnumbers doing that. And if we don't know the why, we can't\n\nget to the how. You need to know why your business is doing\n\nthat before you can take an action to change the business.\n\nAnd if you can't change the business, you can't improve the\n\nmetrics. You can't change the what. So these are all\n\ninterconnected. And ultimately, the dashboard is only giving\n\nyou the what it's the tip of the iceberg of what's happening\n\nin the business. The why is the most essential part of this.\n\nThat's what we can't get out today. And thus, we have all\n\nthese questions that come at us constantly. Why is average\n\norder value off? Why are MQL conversions going down? Why is\n\ncart abandonment up? These are the questions that we're\n\nconstantly trying to answer. And right now our options are\n\njust keep clicking around and dashboards or go to the\n\nanalyst and go into a very involved process. But what would\n\nit look like if we had a different way of doing this? What\n\nwould happen if we started with our why, but we had answers\n\ncoming to us. So using an ecommerce example, a common issue\n\nmight be something with a particular promotion code. Right\n\nnow we can look at something very simply of which promotion\n\ncodes that we've put out are being most effective. But\n\nthat's not usually driving the Why. Yes, one might be\n\nparticularly effective or another might be less effective.\n\nBut it's the nuance inside of it, such as what's being shown\n\nhere. This is an example of one of the findings from the\n\nunsupervised AI. What it's pointing out here is that this\n\nparticular promo code, when it's applied to customers who\n\nare loyalty customers, and they're in a ecommerce session\n\nthat is between these particular lengths, about 30 minutes\n\nto about an hour and 15, we're seeing that for those\n\ncustomers average order value is off. That's the set of\n\ncustomers where that promo codes not working well. That's\n\nthe kind of why that you can actually act on. That's the why\n\nthat drives the how. But it's not the only one. At any given\n\ntime, there's a huge number of things that are affecting\n\nthat metric. So for example, products in a particular family\n\nare probably behaving differently, in one particular place,\n\nthe Northwest region, and in a particular time period. This\n\nis another great example of something where the how of how\n\nyou'd act on this, why is totally different. This is\n\nsomething you might target in ads, you might do different\n\ncampaigns around, and there's gonna be more and more of\n\nthese. Getting to these whys behind your metrics, is what\n\nallows you to have the how's to prove the business. So\n\ntoday, your only choice, if you want to get to that level of\n\na why is to go through the analytical process. Now that\n\nstarts off with a huge amount of data, you've got all of\n\nthese different systems in different silos, different data\n\nwarehouses, all of this different data out there. And it's\n\ntoo much, you can go look at one data source at a time in\n\nthe dashboard that's associated with it. But if you actually\n\nwant to find something across all of that, you need to take\n\nit and prepare that data for analysis. An analyst or a data\n\nengineer is going to take a couple of the sources because\n\nthey just can't handle all that much. They're going to\n\nchoose a couple of the data sources that they think are\n\ngoing to have the why's in them. They're going to bring\n\nthose datasets together, they're going to join them, they're\n\ngoing to choose how to aggregate things across it, they're\n\ngoing to drop a lot of features. In the process of doing\n\nthis, they might engineer a few more. Ultimately, though,\n\nit's just a shadow of your total amount of data that's going\n\nto make it through that, just a tiny sliver. But once you've\n\ngone through that work, which is arduous work. Now you're in\n\na place where you can start looking for insights across that\n\ndata looking for potential why's. And that's hard work as\n\nwell. This is where somebody is going to be using a lot of\n\ntools, BI tools, Python, all sorts of stuff like that to try\n\nto find some interesting patterns in the data. Once they\n\nfind some things in that they're going to prioritize which\n\nof those seem the most important and bring those to the\n\nbusiness? Those are the why's that are going to surface.\n\nAnd at that point we can get to the hows and the actions. At\n\nthat point the business is going to take those they're going\n\nto build strategies for the ones that they think are the\n\nmost actionable, they're going to execute on those\n\nstrategies. And that's what's going to drive the business\n\noutcomes. Now, to be really specific about this, though,\n\nthat first part is entirely driven by people, I might use a\n\ntool like an Alteryx, or Tableau or such. But those tools\n\nare just doing what I tell them to do. So it means it moves\n\nat the speed that I can. And it also means that it's taking\n\nany bias that I have about, for example, which datasets\n\nwe're going to find the answers in, and any mistakes I make\n\nalong the way, and it's just going to propagate them\n\nforward. So it's very limited in what we can do at that\n\npoint. Now, the second half of this, oftentimes, that also\n\nis done by people, but a lot of the biggest innovation that\n\nwe've been talking about as an industry recently has been\n\nusing AI in that part. But that's also very limited in what\n\nyou can do with it. AI is not something that can help you\n\ncome up with a new product, come up with a new marketing\n\ncampaign, what it can do is that for some of the insights\n\nthat you find about something like, you know, these five\n\nfeatures are particularly correlated with the metric you\n\ncare about, it can let you build a model, I can let you do\n\nautomatic scoring, or automatic routing of emails, things\n\nlike that, based on the thing you'd already found. So\n\nthere's value in that that's helpful. But it's only limited\n\nto a small sliver of those why's that you found. And it's no\n\naddressing the top of this funnel, which is where w\n\nactually have the biggest problem. But we add unsupervise\n\nfundamentally do is turn this around, we're bringing AI t\n\nthe beginning of this process work can actually scale to al\n\nof those data sources, we're moving beyond the human limit\n\non how much data we can take in at the top, and how muc\n\ndata we can find patterns across. So that means that no\n\ninstead of spent spending weeks or months trying to fin\n\nthings in that data, it's now minutes to hours, it als\n\nmeans that we've removed a huge amount of bias from th\n\nprocess, we're looking across a lot more data, we're lookin\n\nfor more patterns in it, we're looking for more comple\n\npatterns. That means that things that I would have neve\n\nthought to look for are going to be found through removin\n\nmy bias. And what's also maybe most exciting about this i\n\nthat this scales, we keep coming up with new systems to use\n\nwe keep coming up with new data sources. Every time we d\n\nthat today, it's creating more work for the analyst is goin\n\nto try to use those ultimately. But in this world, it'\n\nlimitless, we can keep adding more and more data. And i\n\nkeeps giving us better and better insights, better why's. B\n\nt the other thing that's still incredibly important in this\n\ns the human aspect. There's a huge role for people in thi\n\n. Because if we can actually find that much wider set of why\n\ns, and put it in front of the business experts in the s\n\nme simple form that they get just the what today, if the s\n\nme people who look at charts can actually see these why'\n\nin plain English, that unlocks huge amounts of value. Yo\n\n've got a much wider funnel of why's that you can ch\n\nose between, you've got more things that are low hanging fr\n\nit, you can come up with more potential strategies,\n\nore actions, new products, new campaigns, new policies, al\n\nof the range of levers that you can pull in the business\n\nhat you can use now. So that means ultimately, bigger outc\n\nmes more money. So let's talk about how it works. There's a\n\nlot of different types of data that you're bringing in r\n\nght now. Some of those are unstructured data, such as p\n\nain English text. And many of those are structured data sou\n\nces like traditional databases. And that data is coming fr\n\nm a lot of places, it's on premise data sources, and its c\n\noud data sources, were able to take all that data from all t\n\nose locations and bring it into the system. The core of\n\nour system is the semantic fabric. Semantic fabric connect\n\nto all of those data sources, and then takes sema\n\ntic information from you information about the data and a\n\nout the business. Understanding relationships in the data,\n\nand that a customer ID in one system is the same thing\n\ns a customer number in another. It gets that kin\n\nof information, which it can then use to intelligently ha\n\ndle the data, joining it on its own, be creating new featu\n\nes, aggregating intelligently, taking that context that you\n\nave in your head and intelligently applying it to the dat\n\nto make that available for all the rest of the process. Now\n\nthe next part of the process is that insight engine at\n\nthe bottom of this diagram, the insight engine is what\n\ncan handle all of the complexity of the data that sema\n\ntic fabric is creating. It's able to go across all of t\n\nose hundreds of 1000s or even millions of features, and\n\nind patterns across t\n\nIt's then able to share those patterns through the Insight\n\nexplore. That is an easy to understand user interface that\n\npeople who right now are limited to charts can look at and\n\nsee exactly what are the most important insights that the AI\n\nis found and interact with those insights. But we don't stop\n\nthere. The most important part of that funnel at the end of\n\nthe day is the actions that are being taken and the impact\n\nthat's being gathered. So we support entirely through that\n\nprocess as well. You can take the insights that are found,\n\nand take the ones that you are choosing as being the most\n\nimportant, the most actionable, and turn them into what we\n\ncall data opportunities. And with opportunities, you're able\n\nto plan what you're going to do around those, keep track of\n\nyour investigations, go through estimations of effort and\n\nreturn track through approval and implementation processes,\n\nand ultimately capture exactly how much ROI came out of\n\nthat. And that still feeds back in. Because we're capturing\n\nthat information, it means this entire AI system can keep\n\ngetting smarter, we can be looking for more and more\n\npatterns that look like the exact type of ones that have\n\ndriven the most impact for you in the past, as well as\n\ncompletely new styles of insights. This is how we unlock\n\nnearly unlimited data to give you the full value that's in\n\nit. So let's go to some real examples of this. One of my\n\nfavorite examples here is Charlotte's Web. They're the\n\nlargest producer of CBD products in the United States. And\n\nthey look like a lot of organizations that are probably\n\nwatching this right now. So they are primarily a CPG\n\ncompany, they sell through channels, a lot of the biggest\n\ndrugstores in the world sell their products. But they're\n\nalso building a direct consumer channel that's incredibly\n\nstrategically important. That's where we come in. They have\n\na three person team that's managing that channel, compared\n\nto armies of people and other organizations that are also\n\nselling their products, or competitive products. And they\n\nneed to understand why critical metrics are behaving the way\n\nthey are. average order value is a great example. But things\n\nlike customer lifetime value are even more important. Let's\n\njust not get big orders today, let's take every one of these\n\nprecious customers and make sure we're maximizing their\n\nimpact. The data that they've analyzed is incredibly\n\ncomplex. It's web interaction data, its customer data from\n\nCRM, and it's all the transactions that those people are\n\ncompleting. And that adds up to a lot 40 million rows of\n\ndata, and growing 17 different source tables that that's all\n\ncoming from across all those systems with over 1200 columns\n\nto start with. But we go a lot further than that, as that\n\nsemantic fabric layer is taking that data and bringing it\n\ntogether, engineering new things off of it, that data has\n\nexpanded by over 400% with new features that the AI has\n\nfound. And it's then going through that at scale to find the\n\nthings that matter in that data, the result of this more\n\nthan 50 actionable insights in just the first six months of\n\nusage in an interface that they can understand every week\n\ncoming in seeing the most important why's that they can act\n\non. And they're following that through. They're taking those\n\ninto the data opportunities as well. So that they're\n\nplanning what they're going to do about them and making sure\n\nthat actions are getting taken across all sorts of different\n\naspects of the business. And so what are the results of that\n\nthey've more than doubled the revenue per customer, they've\n\nover $2 million in opportunities that they've identified.\n\nAnd some of the actions that they've taken are incredibly\n\nimpactful, such as over $100,000 a month in revenue from a\n\nproduct that they previously not focused on, that was\n\nidentified by our insights. And I'll let the customer speak\n\nfor themselves on this. This is something that has\n\nultimately led a team change the game. They're outperforming\n\nthose data armies in other organizations, because they're\n\nstarting with the why. Now they're not alone. A great\n\nexample of financial services company that's just started\n\nwith us understanding what's happening with loan\n\napplications. That's the most important what for them. And\n\nwe're giving them the why.\n\nOne of the most popular consumer services companies a major\n\nfranchise organization, understanding what's happening with\n\ntheir customers returning, they get them in the door the\n\nfirst time, but what's more important is do we get them in\n\nthe second time? And how do we do that most effectively over\n\n$4 million of opportunities in the first eight months of\n\nusage. And one of the largest HR organizations trying to\n\nunderstand what's happening in terms of customer retention,\n\nand all sorts of segments in the business, over $2.4 million\n\nin opportunities. These are all very different\n\norganizations, looking at very different businesses. But at\n\nthe end of the day, it's all about the most important what's\n\nfor them and the why's that are driving it. So that's just a\n\nfew of the organizations that are getting to the why's\n\ndriving their business with Unsupervised AI. And I hope that\n\nyou'll join them soon reach out to get to the why that's\n\ndriving your business"}],"transcript":{"videoId":"96da87df-2213-46fa-be8c-8cff8b1df36f"},"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"f23647","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"language":"","onByDefault":"true","on":"true","async":"false"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"f23647","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"language":"","onByDefault":"true","on":"true","async":"false"}},"vulcan":true}},"options":{}};
